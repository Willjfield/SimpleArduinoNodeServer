# SimpleArduinoNodeServer
A very simple node server that will read Arduino values and a page that is set up to read it

Modified from http://www.openchapters.com/chapter_1.html. Includes necessary node modules.

This is a starting off point for anyone who wants to read values from an Arduino and bring them into a web page or web app. You'll need to adjust the port and pins as needed and run main.js in the root folder.
